# Debian "unstable" releases use apt caching information to get the codename
# see discussion on https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=845651:
#
# > That's all to say that this bug is (to my belief) actually expected behaviour;
# > and fixing it through forcing the codename to be interpreted as "stretch" when
# > apt-cache information is unavailable would be wrong. When /etc/debian_version
# > contains "potato/sid", the codename is either potato xor sid, and only apt-
# > cache can discriminate a testing host from a sid host. Therefore, in such a
# > situation, the correct answer is actually "I can't tell", aka "n/a".
#
# From testing on https://github.com/docker/containerd-packaging/pull/213#issuecomment-782172567,
# it reads the information from these files:
#
#   - /var/lib/apt/lists/deb.debian.org_debian_dists_bullseye_InRelease
#   - /var/lib/apt/lists/deb.debian.org_debian_dists_bullseye_main_binary-amd64_Packages.lz4
#
# Removing these files (`rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`) causes 'lsb_release -sc`
# to print 'n/a'. While we could use '/etc/debian_version' as a fallback for our
# own scripts (stripping everything after '/' (e.g. bullseye/sid -> bullseye),
# dpkg-buildpackage will still depend on this information to be present, and
# if not present, renames packages to use 'n/a' in their path:
#
#    dpkg-buildpackage: info: full upload; Debian-native package (full source is included)
#    renamed '../containerd.io-dbgsym_0.20210219.014044~e58be59-1_amd64.deb' -> '/build/debian/n/a/amd64/containerd.io-dbgsym_0.20210219.014044~e58be59-1_amd64.deb'
#    renamed '../containerd.io_0.20210219.014044~e58be59-1_amd64.deb' -> '/build/debian/n/a/amd64/containerd.io_0.20210219.014044~e58be59-1_amd64.deb'
#
# Given that we don't need the final image (as we only use it as a build environment
# and copy the artifacts out), keeping some of the cache files should not be a problem.
