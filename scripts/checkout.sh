	# git ls-remote's <pattern> argument [1] is a glob [2], and matches anything
	# ending with the given string. This is problematic if multiple tags or
	# branches end with the given pattern. In containerd's case, this returns
	# both tags for the main module ("refs/tags/v1.7.19") and 	# the API module
